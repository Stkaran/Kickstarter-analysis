* Here we can see that, when compared to a variety of other categories, there is a great deal of interest in the type of campaign you are trying to pursue. Therefore, finding backers will most likely not be an issue. However, it is important to set a realistic goal, otherwise there will be a fall off in donations if the goal seems unatainable.

* Our Review found that Mid-May of June appear appear to be the best times to launch a campaign. Also, successful campaigns due seem to run for a shorter amount of time, but this could just be an indication of interest in the campaign. The more popular an idea, the faster it gets funded.
* Lastly, we would suggest bringing down the budget for the UK plays, as the amount you initially proposed appears to have a great deal of difficulty of finding success.
