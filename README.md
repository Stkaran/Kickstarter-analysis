# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
With the successful conclusion of Ms. Louise's Kickstarter campaign, we thought it would be helpful to take another look at the data in order to other useful pieces of information for future endeavors. As you expressed interest in other UK based plays, the analysis focused on the success and failures of other kickstarter campaigns that were funding plays.

### Purpose
The two main focuses of this analysis were the launch dates of campaigns and their funding goals and how these correlated to success or failure. We believe that knowing when to start a campaign and a what a realistic financial goal looks like helps to give you the best chance to find success and allow you to make decisions accordingly.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As you will see below, the best time for starting a campaign was between the months of May and June. As the year went on, there was a steady decline in the amount of successful campaigns, with a short-lived rise in October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
When choosing to what goal to set, there appear to be two categories that are the safest bets. Unsuprisingly, the goals that fell under $5000 found a great deal of success and this is most likely due to the fact that these campaigns don't need as many backers in order for the campaign to be successful. The other sweet spot for successful campaigns was between $35000 and $45000. However, the majority of these productions were put on by whole theaters, which ususally already have dedicated following. So, while higher goals may be possible, a smaller goal has the best chance of finding success.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge of this analysis was finding the data that was most applicalble to your goals. The initial data set consistied of over 4000 entries, however the majority of them were in different fields that did help when looking for successful play campaigns. In order to overcome this, we had to narrow the data down focus specifically on theater productions and then plays. It is also important to note that there were a few successful outliers. These cases make it appear as success increases past the $50000 mark, but these are exceptions to the major trends and should not be used as evidence to start a campaign with a high fundraising goal.

## Result

- As stated before, the best time to launch a campaign would be between May and June. This could be due to the fact it is the beginning other the summer season, and more people have time to engage in research for things of intersest. The absolute worst time to start a campaign is December as many people will likely be spending time with family.

- For funding goals, the primary take away is that as the goals get higher, the less likely a campaign will be successful. There are a few exceptions to this, but in order to succeed at the higher goals, you would most likely need to be part a of larger organization. They have the tools and visibilty to generate more backers that a single person won't have access too. 

- One of the biggest weakness of this dataset was with time. When looking at all of the play kickstarter campaigns, almost every single one fell between the 1-2 month mark for campaign length. It would've been helpful to see if longer campaigns were able to find any success. However, it could also be likely that adding length to a campaign doesn't help with success. If there isn't strong intial intrest in a campaign, there may be no point in extending its length.

- It may also be helpful to create a visualzation of the average backer's donation for successful vs. failed campaigns. This could inform you on what your overall fundraising goal should be, how many backers are needed to succeed, and if there are ways to incentivise more donations.
